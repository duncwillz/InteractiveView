I'll periodically release set of UIs that could come handy in your project in this same repository. 

For learning purpose this UIs are not linked together, components only, nothing like interactions eventhough is named interactive view :).

Will cover device responsiveness and other functionalities in the future. This is what we have for now!!.

Change the name of the view from `ContentView.swift` 
``` swift
    ZStack {
            NeumorphicUI()
            //NeumorphicUI()
            //FinTechHome()
            //NativeComponents()
        }
```
